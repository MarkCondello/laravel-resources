## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

``` sudo pkill mysql```

## Eloquent/Tinker details

The below is a useful tip forviewing the raw sql queries generated by Laravel in tinker

```DB::enableQueryLog();```
Do some tinker queries
```DB::getQueryLog();```


Many To Many
For this relationship to work, a pivot table is required. Usually this includes a composite primary key of the entities it  relates to. It also includes FK's for each one respectively.

Has Many Through (basically an inner join)
In the example in this project, we created an affiliation entity which is connected to a user on the users table.
We use the has many through to get all the posts of users which have a specific affiliation.

$usersArray = Select * from users where affilifation = 1;
Select * from posts where user_id = $usersArray; OR

      "query" => "select `posts`.*, `users`.`affiliation_id` as `laravel_through_key` from `posts` inner join `users` on `users`.`id` = `posts`.`user_id` where `users`.`affiliation_id` = 1",

Polymorphic relations
Allows a model to have a relationship with many models.
In this project we have Videos which morphs to either a Series or a Collection model. 

##Seeding

Generating the Belongs To, Has Many Through data
We can run the Posts seeder which will create a user for each post. Users in turn will create their own Affiliation.
App\Models\Post::factory()->count(22)->create(['user_id' => 1]);


Generating the polymorphic data 
We can create data for the Videos morphTo entity to connect to:
App\Models\Series::factory()->count(4)->create();
App\Models\Collection::factory()->count(4)->create();

Once these above seeds have been added, include a few rows in the Videos table paying attention to the watchable_type as this need to be the same as the model that it is referencing eg:
 1,App\Models\Series,1,Parkour madness,Dazzling stunts in European cities.,youtube.com,2021-02-18 10:09:21,NULL
