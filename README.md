## Laravel Sail setup

In order to connect to the db in the container make sure the port 3306 is available from the host machine
``````

Check other applications running on port 3306
```lsof -i tcp:3306 ```

Laravel Sail no longer works and is not allowing connections to MySql for the root user. 
Access denied for user 'root'@'172.31.0.5' (using password: NO)  

Use php artisan:serve instead.

## Eloquent/Tinker details

The below is a useful tip forviewing the raw sql queries generated by Laravel in tinker

```DB::enableQueryLog();```
Do some tinker queries
```DB::getQueryLog();```

##Seeding

Generating the Belongs To, Has Many Through data
We can run the Posts seeder which will create a user for each post. Users in turn will create their own Affiliation.
App\Models\Post::factory()->count(22)->create(['user_id' => 1]);

Generating the polymorphic data 
We can create data for the Videos morphTo entity to connect to:
App\Models\Series::factory()->count(4)->create();
App\Models\Collection::factory()->count(4)->create();

Once these above seeds have been added, include a few rows in the Videos table paying attention to the watchable_type as this needs to be the same as the model that it is referencing eg:
 1,App\Models\Series,1,Parkour madness,Dazzling stunts in European cities.,youtube.com,2021-02-18 10:09:21,NULL
